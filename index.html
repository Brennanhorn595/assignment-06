    <h1>The Albatross</h1>
    <img src="https://paperairplaneshq.com/images/planes/albatross/albatross.png" alt="A true contender"><br>
    <p>Of course, I had to put this airplane on this list. this paper airplane is one airplane you should know because it is a traditional model.</p>
    <p>This airplane is a very good choice for time aloft and can cover long distances.</p>
    <p>Try throwing it straight up high. it will really pay off</p>
    <h2>The Redwood</h2>
    <img src="https://paperairplaneshq.com/images/planes/redwood/redwood.png" alt="Heavy hitter">
    <p>This airplane is a difficult one for beginners to get right because these new folds maybe too hard for them, but it is well worth the effort</p>
    <p>this airplane is a good addition for speed demons</p>
    <p>This is not the hardest airplane</p>
    <h3>All of ojimak's paper airplanes</h3>
    <p>there are about 88 paper airplanes that were created by him</p>
    <p>I can't tell which one to use because i like them all!</p>
    <p>All of these airplanes are hard, not because they have hard fold techniques, its because of how small the parts are, you need to be precise.</p>
    <p>they need to be folded carefully in order to make it fly right</p>
    <p>And you need a lot of tools o finish them all</p>
